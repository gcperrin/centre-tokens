## Introduction 

The `NATGX` token is a commodity-pegged stable coin (or should I say pseudo-stable) 
that represents market rate for a  single `MMBTU` of natural gas. 
While we use natural gas as underlying asset for the remainder of this 
exercise, it stands to reason that any existing energy-based commodity (Brent Crude,
NYMEX?, I know there are others here...) could serve as the underlying asset.

The model given is an Ethereum-based model. It assumes the existance of the 
`ETH network` or and `EVM-compatible standin` to deploy the contract against. 
I believe in their current form, the interfaces are portable and could be 
reimplemented on any layer 1 protocol. 

* Side note --  It may be worth some serious research on what a polkadot implementation 
might look like...`energy parachain, co-mingled energy pegs on the same parachain ?`

* Word to Markdown?
