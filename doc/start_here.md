# DRAFT: Start here

## Introduction 

The `NATGX` token is a commodity-pegged stable coin (or should I say pseudo-stable) 
that represents market rate for a  single `MMBTU` of natural gas. 
While we use natural gas as underlying asset for the remainder of this 
exercise, any existing energy-based commodity (Brent Crude,
NYMEX?, I know there are others here...) could serve as the underlying asset. 

In addition, other less traditional energy production techniques without any sophisticated 
trading markets solar (kWh), wind(kWh) could be created assuming there are 
market makers (liquidity) and takers to set the price.

The software we have today works assumes the existance of the 
`ETH network` or an `EVM-compatible standin` to deploy the contract against. 
I believe in their current form, the interfaces are portable and could be 
reimplemented on any layer 1 protocol. 

* Side note --  It may be worth some serious research on what a polkadot implementation 
might look like...`energy parachain, co-mingled energy pegs on the same parachain ?`


To understand the architecture

- tokendesign
- masterminter
- deployment
- upgrading

## Almost unncesscary unless you're a dev

- v2_upgrade.md
- v2.1_upgrade.md

## Notes

* I need a novel parachain implementation to understand architecture
* Word to Markdown?
